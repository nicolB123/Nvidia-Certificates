By leveraging LangGraph, we can define the agent's states, transitions, and actions in a structured manner, eliminating the need for a fully-custom event loop.

    "#### Why Is LangGraph Great Overall?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Because it considers so much**. LangGraph is highly customizable to a fault and forces you to abide by best-practices and constraints that may make no sense when you're starting out... but will become impactful later when you actually try to customize, scale up, productionalize.\n",
    "- **Because it's already widely-adopted**. There are many examples and off-the-shelf solutions floating around that people can start out with, and quite a few research projects and final deployments are made with it. \n",
    "- **Because the techniques are transferable**. If you can really understand LangGraph, the other frameworks and their pros/cons become easier to think about. If you only encounter the simplest framework, all subsequent frameworks will look overly-complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Then Is LangGraph Better Than Custom?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When you know you need the abstractions:** Unlike our while-loop which we could massage into a workable multi-state system, LangGraph takes a state graph approach to modeling the agentic traversal process. As such, it incorporates design patterns which scale naturally to non-sequential and even dynamic routines.\n",
    "- **When you don't know where to start, but know you want to productionalize:** Unlike our while-loop which we could massage into a workable multi-state system, LangGraph takes a state graph approach to modeling the agentic traversal process. As such, it incorporates design patterns which scale naturally to non-sequential and even dynamic routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When Is LangGraph Worse Than Custom?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When you just want to make a simple application with some LLMs and some prompts:** In order to account for various multi-agent-specific feature sets and edge cases, LangGraph implements some strong assumptions which greatly increase its learning curve. If you can implement your solutions in basic LangChain, the runnable paradigm is more than sufficient to streamline your pipeline and bypasses several layers of complexity introduced by LangGraph. If, on the other hand, you know you want to scale your application and can benefit from its well-thought-out features/examples, then perhaps it's worth diving in and getting comfortable.\n",
    "- **When you need the deepest optimizations:** While LangGraph is amazing, there is still room beyond LangGraph for deeper optimizations and stronger modularization. Those looking to make highly-specialized microservices may be interested in custom multithreading/multiprocessing schemes, advanced graph algorithms, and advanced resource management strategies which LangGraph may not offer.\n",
    "- **When you just want some persona agents:** You saw the CrewAI API. That one has a much flatter learning curve, but also is not as customizable and is quite tailored for its use-cases. If you would like a lighter approach, that's the pretty simple on-ramp (but will also be easy to backtrack to).\n",

    "1. **A State** (in Python terms, a typed dictionary) that captures the relevant information for your application.  \n",

    "   - The system jumps from the built-in `START` placeholder to the node named `\"input\"`.  \n",

    "       - Interrupt literally breaks the control flow and the graph execution ends into a paused state. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **input** → **response**: Next, we go to `\"response\"`, calling the `response()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It takes `state[\"human_value\"]` (the user’s text) and passes it into `llm.invoke(...)`.  \n",
    "    - The resulting LLM output is stored in `state[\"llm_response\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **response** → **END**: And then, we will go to some last state.\n",
    "   - We haven’t told LangGraph to proceed anywhere else. Without an additional edge from `\"response\"` to another node (or back to `\"node\"`), it will just end. In other words, the control flow halts into a rest state.\n",
    "   - You can add more edges for more steps, or a loop that returns to `\"input\"` for multi-turn usage.\n",

    "#### Actually Running It\n",

    "There are many ways to run this new chain, and superficially it may look somewhat similar to the runnable stuff we were playing with earlier. However, you'll notice that the interrupt mechanism and state buffers require much more handling. Software engineers who need to deeply integrate this system with their other projects would rejoice from those, but those starting out may admittedly feel a bit lost."

It's important to note that as the environment changes, their living areas may expand, while populations in other regions may decline due to human activity.\\n\\nWould there be any changes to the polar bears' habitats if climate change continues?\\n\\nClimate change is expected to alter polar bears' habitats, making them move. Changes in sea ice are particularly relevant, as polar bears rely heavily on sea ice to hunt seals. Reliability of sea ice has been declining due to climate change, which is expected to have significant effects on polar bear populations. Therefore, their habitats could shift northward, potentially north of the Arctic Circle. However, the fate of polar bears is uncertain; large-scale habitat loss or human activity might still threaten this beloved species.\\n\\nI'd be happy to elaborate on specific aspects if you'd like me to dive deeper into a certain area!\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-nano-8b-v1'}, id='lc_run--019c58ad-0341-7b83-8e20-824271da6c00', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 5478, 'output_tokens': 30875, 'total_tokens': 36353})}, next=(), config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '61226389-040d-493b-b2ef-d97228006cda', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1f10919f-bdc6-6a23-8006-75ff3cbf2358'}}, metadata={'source': 'loop', 'step': 6, 'parents': {}}, created_at='2026-02-13T20:24:22.955446+00:00', parent_config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '61226389-040d-493b-b2ef-d97228006cda', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1f10919f-9d05-6243-8005-7a71dbb63f5c'}}, tasks=(), interrupts=())"

    "## **Part 4:** Why Use A Graph Abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "A common argument for why this abstraction is so good comes from the camp of classical dialog modeling folks who may argue that \"this is just the correct way to think about dialog.\" There is an argument to be made here, and you're free to think about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graphs/Networks:** Each **node** is a function that processes or transforms part of your conversation or data. **Edges** specify permissible flows between nodes. For instance, you may want user input first, then an LLM call, then a summarization step, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Finite State Machines (FSMs):** In classic FSM terms, each *distinct combination* of state variables and node identity can be interpreted as an FSM \"state,\" and each **edge** is a transition triggered by certain conditions. For instance, the code below transitions from `[User Input Node]` to `[LLM Response Node]` unconditionally. In a richer scenario, you might condition on the user’s text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Markov Chains:** If you’re dealing with stochastic or probability-driven transitions, you can think of each node and subsequent edges as forming a Markov chain. The key difference is that in Markov chains, transitions are typically governed by probability distributions. In LangGraph, you can incorporate your own branching logic—possibly using the LLM’s output to determine next steps.  \n",

    "In computers, agent-based simulations are also structured like this, and there exists a discrete time loop at some level of abstraction. The issues are:\n",
    "- There are a discrete number of processes, and processes invoke other processes.\n",
    "- For a given time-step, the number of processes can be very large or very small. Usually, this can can only be determined by observation.\n",
    "- We like to observe, monitor, control, and version (time-travel), and this requires memory and compute overhead and hard design decisions.\n",
    "- The number of processes can scale dramatically with the number of users, complexity of macro-processes, and increase or resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we have reconstructed the problem of process management in computer architectures. Which we generally don't have to worry about. So why bother now?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Because now we're doing it in an high-abstraction framework like Python where discrete-time simulation is very inefficient and hard to scale manually, and need the flexibility to define our own processes propagation, monitoring, concurrent execution, replication, and versioning.** And it turns out that's a challenge, as discussed in the lecture."

It still has some clear limitations associated with it, and technically there are higher barrier-of-entry options that have less of those:\n",
    "- **Custom graph systems** can be implemented using some key abstractions, and they can be truly customized for any arbitrary use-cases. This is, in fact, what LangGraph creates and supports under the hood. However, this problem explodes in complexity as you start implementing the feature sets necessary in modern-day LLM applications, and your solutions will be inherently bespoke unless released as a unified framework.\n",
    "- [**NVIDIA Morpheus**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/morpheus/) is another useful abstraction which offers advanced data pipeline solutions that could be used to pipe inference streams, track analytics, and optimize pipelines with CUDA-accelerated workflows. With that being said, it doesn't have all of the niceties associated with LangGraph for the agentic use-case. The Morpheus - LangGraph divide is similar to the LangGraph - CrewAI divide in terms of complexity, so it's not actually a bad idea to use, but will have less built-in conveniences."

    "For those of you just starting out with building agent systems of any kind, LangGraph may seem intimidating. In fact, many engineers who have more limited-scope problems can probably get by with just the LangChain abstractions from the previous sections (which the previous courses go into depth on). At the same time, more experienced engineers who have a strong grasp of agentic software paradigms can straddle the line anywhere between primitive-based and framework-enabled orchestration, and can hopefully make the right design decisions to enable their solution at any scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "We like to treat LangGraph as a great starting abstraction which works **by default** for some of the largest models, **with extra effort** for a selection of models, and **with significant modification** for an even-greater set of possible interfaces. *(Unfortunately, the Llama-8B model may fall under the middle or last category, as you will see in the next notebook)*. With that said, at least it has some simple ways into the ecosystem and can scale by default into production use-cases without too much hassle. As such, we will use this framework for the rest of the course as necessary to enable our agentic loops.\n",
