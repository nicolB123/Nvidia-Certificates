For example, $P(t_{m..m+n} | t_{0..m-1})$ might generate a series of $n$ tokens (substrings) from $m$ tokens by iterating on $P(t_{i} | t_{0..i-1})$ starting at $i=m$.\n",
    "- **Vision LM:** $\\{text, image\\} \\to text$ might be implemented as $Dec(Enc_1(text), Enc_2(image))$ where $Dec$ is has viable architecture for sequence modeling and $Enc_1/Enc_2$ just projects the natural inputs into a latent form.\n",
    "- **Diffusion Model:** $\\{text\\} \\to image$ might be implemented as $Dec(...(Dec(Dec(\\xi_0))...)$ where $Dec$ iteratively denoises from a canvas of noise while also taking in some encoding $Enc(text)$ as conditioning.\n",

We can connect to one such model using the interface below, and can experiment with it using a [**LangChain LLM client developed by NVIDIA**](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/nvidia_ai_endpoints/) - which is really just a client that works with any OpenAI-style LLM endpoint with a few extra conveniences."

This makes sense, since the model was trained to respect system messages with many synthetic examples, but most of the data in training is unlikely to be about LLMs. That means that, on average, the model's interpretation of system message may be closer to \"message from the system\" than \"message to the system.\"\n",

    "    - Assuming the LLM could have reasonably produced the example outputs, then this may be good for locking down the model outputs to a specific format.\n",
    "    - If the exemplified outputs are strongly unreasonable and explicitly put words into the assistant's response field, then this strategy can backfire for smaller models.\n",
    "- We can also try to move out general instructions/requirements into **the system message**. This field is classically more influential in pre-trained models.\n",
    "    - But your mileage may vary. Some models use wildly different schemes, some explicitly override or ignore system messages by design (training for other patterns and formats entirely).\n",

We would like to put several personas into an environment and see where the conversation goes, and we want this to be a bit deeper than our shallow \"share the system message and just keep going\" exercise above. This kind of setup is useful for long-horizon reasoning evaluation, where an LLM system developer might pair their application with one or more AI-driven user personas and see where it goes. \n",

In this case, the agents will be highly stateful and will have an internal memory of transactions. With this \"memory\" as the single source of truth, we may experience drift as our system becomes more complex and we add modification pipelines to our agents. With that said, I guess it's more human-like, right?\n",
