Specifically, we'd like to know what it can actually reason about, how well it can consider its inputs, and what that suggests for our ability to interact with an external (or even internal) environment.

    "If you haven't coded much with LLMs, the previous section may be surprising. If anything, the vagueness with which these systems are able to operate is impressive and the self-corrective behavior is a real game-changer for many conversational applications. With that said, these systems have some inherent weaknesses: \n",
    "- They are influenced to think and act by prompt engineering, but they are not \"forced\" to think in any specific configuration.\n",
    "- The memory systems are easy to taint with message history which steers the dialog into poor directions, opening up opportunities for subtle but compounding quality degredation.\n",
    "- The output is inherently natural language, and does not lend itself to be easily connected with regular software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that we may want to try to lock down our LLM interface and avoid the natural accumulation of state in use cases where multi-turn dialog is not necessary. And when multi-turn dialog is necessary but we still need more control, we may need to restrict and normalize the accumulating context to make sure everything stays in line."

Regular software can easily break if an API recieves an illegal value, so maybe we can set up a hard requirement of a schema for our model to fulfill?\n",

       "\n",
       "Now, I need to go through each letter one by one and count the Rs. Let's start from the beginning. The first letter is S, then T. The third letter is R. That's the first R. Next is A, then W, B, E. The next letters after E are R and R again. So that's two more Rs. Then the last letter is Y. \n",

Let me confirm by writing the word again and underlining or noting each R. S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Yes, positions 3, 8, and 9. So three Rs. I think that's correct. I don't think there are any other Rs in the word. Let me count once more to be sure. S (1), T (2), R (1), A (3), W (4), B (5), E (6), R (7), R (8), Y (9). Wait, maybe my numbering is off.

    "Recall how we had our expert systems which backbone on our LLM. We said they were leaky and seemed to work pretty well for some classes of input while compromising performance in others. In fact, they are literally fit to form for a particular class of inputs. In the space of natural language (or, even moreso, the space of all possible tokens configurations that could be fed in as input), it may be a bit hard to define what an LLM is really good for, but we can set this kind of structure up:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Canonical Form:** This is the standard form that a particular system accepts as input. In graphics, this may be a T-posed mesh. In algorithms, this may be a function signature. And in chemistry, it may be a standard notation.\n",
    "- **Canonical Grammar:** Assuming a standard form can be defined, this is the set of rules governing what strings are valid or allowable to conform to your given form. This includes a definition of a **\"vocabulary,\"** (primitives of a language) but is stronger because it also governs how the vocabulary instances can be arranged together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's assume we have two leaky abstractions, *Agent 1* and *Agent 2*, which are inherently leaky but are form-fit to their own particular problems. Then:**\n",
    "- We can define \"canonical forms\" for the inputs of the two agents. These are specific representations that they are especially adept at handling, and we can form-fit them to work well for those inputs.\n",
    "- We can then assume that if a non-canonical input is fed into an agent, there is a mapping that has to occur (explicitly or implicitly) to get back to the canonical form so that the agent can deal with it as input.\n",
    "    - With regular code, there are usually a lot of checks in place to yell if people pass in illegal arguments. The user and their code are responsible for guaranteeing that arguments are in standard form.\n",
    "    - With semantic reasoning systems, this happens implicitly, but the further away the input drifts from canonical, the harder it is to map to a canonical form.\n",
    "- By this abstraction, two connected expert systems can communicate with one another if the former outputs to the canonical form of the latter. *And for semantic systems, if the output of the former is close enough.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concrete Example: Implicit Canonical Form**\n",
    "\n",
    "More concretely, let's say we have the following system message bound to an LLM client:\n",
    "> \"You are an NVIDIA chatbot! Please help the user out with NVIDIA products, stay on track, answer as briefly as necessary, and be nice and professional.\"\n",

    "```\n",

    "But the input has drifted significantly from that, and you then need to hope that the chatbot \"understands better\" or the LLM \"has good enough priors.\" In other words, you're hoping that your system can reasonably map from the user question to the implicit canonical form defined by the mechanisms (training priors, system message, history, etc) of your receiving system.\n",

Many people engineer solutions like that, and have simple post-processing routines which try to error-check and filter out the Python from the non-Python (and to be honest, some library-included systems have gotten pretty good over the past year or so). The canonical form is clearly valid Python with legal syntax and references, but enforcing that for non-trivial inputs requires both a strong LLM, a lot of context injection, and some feedback loops which we will discuss later.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concrete Example: Explicit Canonical Form For Function Calling**\n",

    "Unlike Python code - which requires both static and runtime analysis to legalize - JSON schemas can be validated pretty easily with requirements like \"list of strings,\" \"one of n literal values,\" etc. They are also descriptive enough to encompass function calls, as a function with parameters is just a literal selection followed by a dictionary of named arguments.\n",

    "Structured output is incredibly promising and is already widely-adopted in many powerful systems and to various extents. Both LangChain and CrewAI have mechanisms for invoking it, and they go about different approaches for abstracting it. \n",
    "- As per usual, the LangChain primitives enable you to customize exactly how all of the prompt mechanisms are handled, even if it does feel a bit manual. There's still plenty of little details which they are abstracting away, but those are probably for the better.\n",
    "- In contrast, CrewAI has a more abstract wrapper which automates a lot of the prompt injection efforts and makes assumptions that tune it well for the more powerful and feature-rich models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With that said, the exact mechanisms in which structured output is fulfilled ranges wildly:**\n",
    "- Some LLM servers accept a schema and prompt-engineer the schema into the the system/user prompts to align to the model's training routine.\n",
    "    - In contrast, some LLM servers don't, and require you to manually do the prompt engineering client-side.\n",
    "- Some LLM servers will actually return guaranteed well-formatted JSON responses because they actually limit the generation of next tokens to a valid grammar.\n",
    "    - And some don't, in which case the LLM orchestration library like LangChain has to parse out the legal response.\n",
    "    - And sometimes, this is a glass-half-full good thing because generating the schema without any forethought may push a given model out-of-domain and derail it.\n",
    "- Some systems are happy to take structured output back as historical inputs to help guide the systems.\n",
    "    - And some systems don't do that, either fully rejecting the structured output or \"ignoring\" it, causing knowable or unknowable degradation of your loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, an LLM also generally needs to be trained with structured output or explicit function-calling support in mind, as otherwise (or even regardless), the LLM can still be pushed into out-of-domain generation if it's not supposed to output structured output (even if it is actually forced to).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In other words, this is a fantastic feature, really defines the future of connection to both code and between LLMs, but is also experimentally supported and has inconsistent engineering (or even feasibility) depending on the model and software stack.**\n",

In theory, this may be rectified with in-context examples and the right prompt engineering, but a solution is not guaranteed or even deducible outside of trial-and-error.\n",
