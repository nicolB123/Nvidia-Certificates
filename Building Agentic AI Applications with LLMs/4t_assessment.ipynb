    "**Welcome To The Assessment!** We hope you're ready to apply some of the skills you've learned so far towards building something you've probably seen floating around; a \"researching\" chatbot. The overall idea should be pretty familiar:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The chatbot should look at your question and look around the internet for some resources.**\n",
    "- **Based on those resources, the chatbot should make an educated guess based on its retrieved information.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is implemented often in conjunction with LLM interfaces like ChatGPT and Perplexity, and various open-source efforts have cropped up to simplify the process. With that being said, they usually don't rely on the likes of 8B models due to the finicky nature of routing them properly. As such, we will merely be testing you on your ability to implement the following primitives: \n",
    "- **A structured output interface to produce a parseable list.**\n",
    "- **A function to search for web snippets and filter out the most relevant results.**\n",
    "- **A mechanism for accumulating message beyond the control of the user.**\n",
    "- **Some basic prompt engineering artifacts.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Of note, there are many extensions which you should be able to imagine at this point. Perhaps we could have a requerying mechanism somewhere? Or maybe either the user or the agent could criticize and remove entries from the history? Long-term memory does sound appealing, after all. However, we will be focusing on just our simple features as required for two key reasons:\n",
    "- **First, we really don't want to force you to do more engineering than you have to.** Frameworks like LangGraph may have many levers and introduce new primitives very quickly in an attempt to simplify the interface, so any overengineering we do now may become deprecated by the time you're reading this with some simpler off-the-shelf options.\n",
    "- **Secondly, our Llama-3.1-8B model inherently makes this more challenging for us due to its limitations.** This level of challenge is important to understand and work with, since you are better-equipped to decompose harder challenges and leverage your tools to their fullest as you scale up. With that said, a multi-turn long-term-memory research agent implemented with Llama-8B is quite tedious at the moment, with many of the streamlines interfaces assuming a stronger model."

      "\n",
      "To begin, it's essential to understand what LangGraph is. LangGraph is a Python library designed for building robust and reliable stateful AI agents as graphs. It allows you to manage the flow of complex Large Language Model (LLM) workflows, making it easier to orchestrate and manage AI agents in your projects. (Source: https://realpython.com/langgraph-python/)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 2: Concrete Example (Include code or a worked mini-example)**\n",
      "\n",
      "To illustrate how LangGraph works, let's look at an example from one of our sources. In the tutorial by Analytics Vidhya, you can find the following code snippet:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import langchain\n",
      "\n",
      "# Create an agent with a simple flow\n",
      "agent = langchain Agent(\n",

      "\n",
      "**Step 3: How to Verify / Experiment / Apply**\n",

      "To verify your progress and apply LangGraph in your projects, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Verify:**\n",
      "   - Check if your agent is responding as expected when invoked.\n",
      "   - Review the logs to ensure that the flow is running correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Experiment:**\n",
      "   - Try customizing the flow files to create different workflows.\n",
      "   - Experiment with different prompts and prompts to see if LangGraph can benefit from them.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Apply:**\n",
      "   - Once you're confident with LangGraph, you can use it to build and deploy robust AI agents in your projects.\n",
      "   - Familiarize yourself with other features of LangGraph, such as increased support for memory management and more flexible AI model customization. (Source: https://langgraph.io/)\n",

       "\n",
       "Memory management is a vital aspect of LangGraph, as it ensures the efficient allocation and deallocation of memory resources, which is crucial for building intelligent and context-aware applications. LangGraph, like other memory management systems, employs various strategies to manage memory, ensuring that memory is used optimally without causing performance issues. (Source 3: https://github.com/FareedKhan-dev/langgraph-long-memory)\n",
       "\n",
       "Step 2: Concrete Example\n",
       "\n",
       "Let's consider the concept of memory management in LangGraph more closely. One of the key features of LangGraph is its Store feature, which manages how memory is saved, retrieved, and updated, depending on where you are running your project.

       "Step 1: Core Concept(s)\n",
       "\n",
       "Subgraphs in LangGraph are used to break down complex graph structures into smaller, more manageable components. This concept is crucial for tasks such as graph coloring, clustering, and network analysis, as it allows for modular design and code reusability. (Based on Source 1 and Source 3, inline-cited URLs are omitted for brevity, but the content from the snippets is referenced.)\n",
       "\n",
       "Step 2: Concrete Example\n",
       "\n",
       "An induced subgraph is a subgraph that is formed by removing every other edge and node that is not in a particular subgraph. For instance, consider a graph with nodes A, B, C, and D, and edges AB, BC, CD. An induced subgraph of {A, B, C} would retain all edges between these nodes, resulting in edges AB and BC. This example illustrates how induced subgraphs can be used to analyze specific sections of a graph, such as in machine learning tasks where features are extracted from subsets of data. (Source 2 mentions that subgraphs are used for various purposes, which aligns with this example.)\n",
       "\n",
       "Step 3: How to Verify / Experiment / Apply\n",
       "\n",
       "To verify or experiment with subgraphs in LangGraph, one can define specific subgraphs and group nodes within them. This can be done by creating a subgraph and calling the `add_nodes()` and `add_edges()` methods to add nodes and edges to the subgraph. To apply a subgraph for graph coloring, for example, you can use a subgraph to define the nodes that are to be colored and then apply a coloring algorithm (such as the greedy algorithm) to the subgraph. (Source 1 provides guidance on how to use subgraphs, which is relevant to this step.)\n",

       "\n",
       "Full-duplex communication allows two devices to transmit data to each other simultaneously, this is in contrast to half-duplex communication where data flows in one direction at a time. This simultaneous transmission and reception on the same frequency is also known as simultaneously transmit and receive (STAR) systems [3]. Full-duplex communication can significantly enhance network performance by doubling spectral efficiency and reducing latency.\n",

       "\n",
       "Step 2: Concrete Example\n",
       "\n",
       "To illustrate the concept, let's consider a simple LAN network with three PCs connected through a hub. In a full-duplex scenario, when an electrical signal enters one hub port, the hub repeats that signal out of all other ports (except the incoming port). This means that all devices can receive the signal simultaneously. This is different from a half-duplex scenario where the hub would only forward the signal to one device at a time [4].\n",

       "Example: All three PCs can receive the electrical signal simultaneously in this full-duplex communication scenario.\n",
       "\n",
       "Step 3: How to Verify/Application\n",
       "\n",
       "To verify full-duplex communication, one can use tools like network analyzers or ping commands to measure the signal strength and delay in the network. In a full-duplex network, the signal strength should be the same for all devices at the same time, indicating simultaneous transmission and reception. Additionally, the latency should be lower compared to a half-duplex network since the signal travels only once between devices [5].\n",

       "<blockquote>\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 1: Core Concept**\n",
       "\n",
       "LangGraph's visualization engine is built on a force-directed layout algorithm (Frumdlich's layout), which is a widely used graph drawing technique. This algorithm focuses on the structural relations and interactions between nodes and edges, rather than focusing on individual data cases. The layout is primarily based on the weights of the edges, which reflect the importance or the strength of the connection between nodes. However, user preferences and the specific nature of the graph being explored can also influence the layout.\n",
       "\n",
       "Source: https://github.com/hanjo-huhang/LangGraph\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 2: Concrete Example**\n",
       "\n",
       "To better understand how LangGraph's visualization works, let's consider a simple example with a word graph. Suppose we have the following words: \"tree\", \"icy\", \"blue\", \"car\", \"ice\".\n",
       "\n",
       "We can create a word graph where each node represents a word, and each edge represents a common word ending (or a predicate) between two words. For instance, we can create the following edges:\n",
       "* \"tree\" and \"icy\" have the word ending \"tree\" in common (for example, if we're looking at tree transportation or transport)\n",
       "* \"tree\" and \"blue\" have the word ending \"blue\" in common (such as in \"blue tree\")\n",
       "\n",
       "The visualization of this word graph should show \"tree\" connected to both \"icy\" and \"blue\". The specific layout will depend on the weights of these edges. According to Frumdlich's layout, the heavier the edge, the closer the nodes will be to each other. In this example, assume that the weight of the edge between \"tree\" and \"icy\" is 1.5 and the weight between \"tree\" and \"blue\" is 1.0. The resulting layout will show \"tree\" closer to \"icy\" than to \"blue\", reflecting the higher weight of the \"tober\" edge.\n",
       "\n",
       "Source: https://github.com/lwdee/Links-for-Vis-design/blob/master/force-directed-layout.cpp\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 3: How to Verify / Experiment / Apply**\n",
       "\n",
       "To verify that the visualization is working as expected, you can:\n",
       "\n",
       "* Tweak the layout parameters and observe the changes in the graph.\n",
       "* Compare the resulting graph layout with a human-created graph to see if they tell similar stories.\n",
       "* Use LangGraph's API to programmatically analyze the layout of the graph.\n",
       "\n",
       "To include complex information in the graph, you can update the node labels, edge labels, or node sizes to reflect the relevant details. For instance, you can label the word \"tree\" with the following information: \"informal  Buy\" or \"Cool\".\n",
       "\n",
       "Source: https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/1900.07878.pdf\n",
       "\n",
       "To share the visualization with others or save it for later reference, you can export the graph in a file format such as PNG or SVG. LangGraph supports various export options, such as saving the graph as a PNG, SVG, or HTML.\n",

       "\n",
       "LangGraph is a flexible AI framework designed for building and orchestrating reliable and stateful AI agents. Its primary goal is to support diverse control flows, such as single-agent, multi-agent, hierarchical, and sequential, while handling complex and realistic scenarios. To proceed, I will analyze user feedback, trends, and recent advancements in the field to predict potential future features.\n",

       "\n",
       "Step 2: Concrete Example\n",
       "\n",
       "One potential feature is the integration of more advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as transformer models like BERT or GPT-3, into LangGraph. These models offer improved language understanding and generation capabilities, which could be leveraged to create more complex and context-aware agents. For instance, a development team could build a LangGraph agent that interprets human instructions in various languages and supplies tailored responses, demonstrating its added NLP capabilities. This feature could be showcased in a project like badge-grade badminton tournaments, where AI-powered systems assist coaches with game recommendations and strategy suggestions.

       "\n",
       "Step 3: Verification and Application\n",
       "\n",
       "To verify the impact of new features, developers could monitor agent performance metrics, such as latency, cost, and success rate, to ensure a reliable production-ready system. To apply new features, one could transfer a LangGraph agent to a new development environment and introduce the new NLP capabilities. Here, a team could use LangGraph's tools to evaluate how well the AI interprets and responds to an large number of diverse human inputs, replicating a real-world scenario. This step confirms that the new feature meets the community's needs and is beneficial for the LangGraph ecosystem.  (Source 1: example_langgraph_agents.ipynb - Colab ( Use inline citation ) )\n",

Specifically, can you tell me about Memory Management?', 'answer': 'Step 1: Core Concept(s)\\n\\nMemory management is a vital aspect of LangGraph, as it ensures the efficient allocation and deallocation of memory resources, which is crucial for building intelligent and context-aware applications. LangGraph, like other memory management systems, employs various strategies to manage memory, ensuring that memory is used optimally without causing performance issues. (Source 3: https://github.com/FareedKhan-dev/langgraph-long-memory)\\n\\nStep 2: Concrete Example\\n\\nLet\\'s consider the concept of memory management in LangGraph more closely. One of the key features of LangGraph is its Store feature, which manages how memory is saved, retrieved, and updated, depending on where you are running your project. For example, if you are running LangGraph in-memory, the Store feature helps ensure that memory is allocated and deallocated efficiently. (Source 1: https://github.com/FareedKhan-dev/langgraph-long-memory)\\n\\nSource 2: No snippet provided for this step, but the main idea is to illustrate how the Store feature works in different environments.\\n\\nStep 3: How to Verify / Experiment / Apply\\n\\nTo verify or experiment with memory management in LangGraph, you can explore its official documentation and guides, such as the Comprehensive Guide: Long-Term Agentic Memory With LangGraph (Source 2: https://medium.com/@anil.jain.baba/long-te"

It provides three logical steps, which meets the minimum requirement, but the steps are superficial. The 'Concrete Example' section promises code but delivers none, and Step 2 relies on a placeholder statement about the Store feature without any implementation details. Additionally, the response repeats source citations and uses generic phrasing like 'Source 2: No snippet provided', indicating placeholder content. To improve, include a short, annotated code snippet that shows how to bind a memory saver, explain allocation versus deallocation clearly, and reference at least three distinct insights from the retrieved material. Overall, the answer is on the right track but lacks depth and concrete illustration, so it falls around a mid‑range score.\n",

It also attempts to illustrate usage with a code snippet, which adds a concrete element. However, the answer falls short in several important ways: (1) the logical steps are only superficially distinct and do not build new insights—each step largely repeats the same information without deeper analysis; (2) the provided code contains placeholder identifiers and typographical errors (e.g., `langchain_chan.LanglChainChan`, `CADLActor`) that make it non‑executable and suggest a scaffold rather than a fully‑developed example; (3) citations are occasionally duplicated or mis‑referenced, and the inline‑citation format is inconsistent; (4) the answer does not explore Pregel’s query language, data model, or practical tips for optimizing queries, which were part of the research trace; (5) the explanation remains fairly high‑level and does not connect the cited sources to actionable knowledge or novel connections. To improve, the answer should (a) separate the explanation into at least three clearly different logical sections (e.g., architectural role, execution model, and practical optimization), (b) provide a correct, minimal runnable snippet that demonstrates state propagation across supersteps, (c) integrate citations to highlight how each source contributes a unique insight, and (d) adopt a conversational tone that walks the reader through the concepts step‑by‑step.

       "[Case 2] Score: 5/10 - Your answer correctly identifies three distinct steps—understanding the core concept of subgraphs, providing a concrete example with induced subgraphs, and describing how to verify or experiment with them. This meets the structural requirement of at least three logical steps. However, the response falls short in a few important areas: (1) it does not embed inline citations for the sources it references, violating the instruction to cite URLs directly when using content; (2) the explanation is rather superficial and repeats generic statements without deeper insights or concrete LangGraph code examples; (3) the discussion of applications such as graph coloring is broad and lacks specific guidance on how to implement these tasks within LangGraph. To improve, incorporate explicit inline citations (e.g., [Source 2]) wherever you draw from the retrieved snippets, add a brief code snippet or workflow diagram illustrating subgraph creation, and expand on at least one concrete use case (e.g., using a subgraph for modular routing in a multi‑agent system).

The question asked specifically about LangGraph, yet the answer never mentions LangGraph or ties the concept to that framework, leaving the core query unanswered. The reasoning is organized into three steps, which meets the minimum of distinct logical steps, but the steps are superficial and repeat information from the retrieved snippets without adding new synthesis or insight. Additionally, some citations are incomplete or point to placeholder URLs, and the answer repeats large blocks of snippet text without proper integration. To improve, the answer should explicitly connect full‑duplex communication to LangGraph (e.g., how LangGraph’s architecture may use full‑duplex concepts), provide clearer citations, and expand on the benefits and applications with more original analysis.\n",

First, it uses placeholder citations instead of inline URL references, which violates the requirement to cite sources directly where they are used. The same source is repeated multiple times without adding new insight, making the explanation feel redundant and scaffold‑like rather than conversational. Additionally, the response stops at a high‑level summary and does not discuss key productionalization topics such as model versioning, containerization, or orchestration, so it lacks the depth needed for a thorough understanding. To improve, embed the URLs inline after each claim, expand each step with specific best‑practice details (e.g., using MLflow for versioning, Docker for container images, Kubernetes for orchestration), and adopt a more natural, flowing narrative that guides the reader through a practical workflow.\n",

       "[Case 5] Score: 5/10 - The response tries to break the explanation into discrete steps, which shows an effort at structured reasoning. It identifies a force‑directed layout, gives a concrete word‑graph example, and suggests ways to verify the layout. However, the citations are either generic or do not correspond to the provided sources, and several statements (e.g., “Frumdlich's layout”) appear fabricated. The answer lacks depth about LangGraph’s actual visualization pipeline, repeats similar source references without new insight, and contains placeholder‑like URLs that do not support the claims. Overall, it demonstrates basic logical structuring but falls short on thoroughness, accuracy, and genuine new knowledge.\n",

       "[Case 6] Score: 3/10 - The answer correctly cites a few sources and provides a very basic OCR snippet, which is a modest strength. However, it falls short in several key areas: (1) it misstates that Tesseract is “built on top of Language Detection for Python (LangDetect‑PY)”, which is factually incorrect; (2) it does not address LangGraph at all – the question explicitly asks for a LangGraph‑centric example, yet the response stays within a generic OCR workflow; (3) the three steps are repetitive scaffold‑like headings that add little new insight and do not demonstrate deeper understanding of how OCR can be integrated into a LangGraph graph (e.g., using image‑processing nodes, streaming events, or chaining with other agents); (4) the language is overly terse and lacks a conversational tone, and the code example contains errors (e.g., using `img.read()` on a Pillow Image object, which is unnecessary). To improve, the answer should explain how an image can be fed into a LangGraph node, show a minimal graph that runs OCR, include proper error handling, and connect the extracted text back into the graph’s state, while citing sources inline and keeping the discussion conversational.\n",

       "\n",
       "[Case 7] Score: 4/10 - The answer attempts to follow the requested structure—covering a core concept, providing a concrete example, and describing verification/application—but it falls short on several fronts. First, many citations are incomplete or mismatched (e.g., URLs and snippet links do not correspond to the quoted text), and some referenced sources are not actually used to support the predictions. Second, the three logical steps are present but are fairly generic; they do not deliver deep, novel insights into future LangGraph features, nor do they convincingly tie predictions to observed trends or community feedback. The ‘Concrete Example’ introduces a vague NLP integration scenario (e.g., badge‑grade badminton tournaments) that adds little substantive value. Additionally, the answer repeats boilerplate statements about future features without demonstrating a rigorous analytical process. To improve, the response should: (1) cite sources accurately with correct inline links, (2) build each step on distinct, well‑explained reasoning, and (3) expand on concrete, anticipatable features grounded in the retrieved material. Overall, the answer is weak on thoroughness and new insight, meriting a modest score.\n",
